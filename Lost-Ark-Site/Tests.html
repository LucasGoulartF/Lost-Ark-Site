    <p>
    <h3>THE DAWNING AGE</h3>
    <hr>
    The god Regulus brings order and light to balance the darkness of chaos and creates worlds to embody each: Arkesia
    and Petrania. The order of the light is powered by the Ark, split seven ways for seven gods and spread across
    Arkesia. When the two worlds nearly destroy each other the Guardians are created to restore peace.
    </p>
    <h3>RULE OF DARKNESS</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        While Arkesia prospers with the power of the Ark, Petrania embraces chaos until Kazeros, Lord of the Abyss,
        emerges
        to establish a dark order. He creates the Red Moon to imitate the sun, kills off most of the other demons, and
        forms
        an army of demon legions. The prophecy of another rift is nigh.

    <h2>Path.Notes</h2>

    <h3>INTRODUCING THE EUROPE WEST REGION</h3>

    <p>
        On Thursday, February 17 at 6PM CET (9AM PT), we will open a second region for European players. Before you
        decide
        where to call home, here’s everything you need to know.
    </p>

    <p>
        Due to overwhelming demand in Europe we are opening a second region for players: Europe West. This has been a
        complex process that required 24/7 effort from both the Amazon Games and Smilegate RPG teams. We want to thank
        you
        for your patience while we worked on this. <br> We’ve been blown away by the number of players and can’t wait to
        welcome
        more of you into Arkesia.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new region, Europe West, will go live at 6PM CET (9AM PT) on Thursday, February 17
    </p>
    <p>
        We expect opening a new region to reduce, not eliminate, queue times for Europe Central. However, players
        choosing
        the new Europe West region are much less likely to experience long queues.<br> Please note, if you move to the
        new
        region you will continue to be able to use your Royal Crystals and Crystalline Aura but no redeemed, claimed, or
        acquired items move with you. The launch celebration gift we announced on Sunday will be granted to all players
        (regardless of server or region). who logs in and enters Arkesia between February 20 at 8:59AM CET
        (February
        19, 11:59AM PT) through March 2 at 8:59AM CET (March 1 at 11:59PM PT) will receive the gift. In addition, for
        players choosing to play on Europe West, we’ll be granting some progression support:
    </p>
    <p>
        We understand that players have been collecting daily attendance rewards since launch and we don’t want players
        migrating to Europe West to miss out, so the last 10 days of daily attendance rewards will be granted
        automatically
        to all characters on Europe West with the next maintenance.
        Europe West players will also see special daily attendance rewards for the first 10 days of the Europe West
        server
        launch, in addition to the daily attendance rewards mentioned above.
        The Europe West region will launch with eight servers. Additional servers will be opened if needed, based on
        population levels. The eight starting servers are:
