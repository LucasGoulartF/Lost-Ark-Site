    <h2>Introdution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Video game[a] or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or
                input
                device
                – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback.
                This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual
                reality
                headset. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones,
                and
                sometimes
                with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.
                Computer games are not all video games—for example text adventure games, chess, and so on do not depend
                upon
                a
                graphics display.
        <li>
            <p>Video games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games,
                console games, and personal
                computer (PC) games.
                More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers,
                virtual and
                augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming.
                Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.
